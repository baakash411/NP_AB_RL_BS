Description:

This assignment was a lesson in how to modify a navigation drawer to suit our app's needs.

Team member roles in assignment: (Who does what)

Bharath: Worked on code and documentation.
Nikolai: Worked on code and documentation.
Aakash: Worked on code and documentation.
Rishabh: Worked on code and documentation.

Key Lessons learned:
In Part 1, we  learned about only the portions of this code that are relevant to the Navigation Drawer. For Part 2, we needed to add fragments to our app, allowing for modular design that will make it easy to port to tablets or other devices at a later time. We also need to create a home for the Fragment in our layout, as well as create the Fragments in ApplicantActivity and write code to give the app code logic for how to switch between them. Part 3:  As a responsible member of the cyber community, we should never reveal too much personal information about ourselves, such as your full name and address, Social Security number, and credit card numbers unless you are absolutely certain the website or application is trusted. We need to sign a document. 


Conclusion Questions

Answer # 36, 37 and conclusion questions here:

Why is a navigation drawer a good fit for the College App?

The navigation drawer is a good fit for the College App because it is a panel that displays the app’s main navigation options on the left edge of the screen. It is hidden most of the time, but is revealed when the user swipes a finger from the left edge of the screen or, while at the top level of the app, the user touches the app icon in the action bar.

Use the Internet to find at least three non-official sources of information that you could use to help you work with navigation drawers as an app developer. Describe your findings.

One use for the navigation drawer is when the user selects an item in the drawer's list, the system calls onItemClick() on the OnItemClickListener given to setOnItemClickListener(). Another use for the navigation drawer is basically to create a menu sidebar, for example in proto.io, our app design has a sidebar that can navigate you to a different page. Another use for the navigation drawer is to just keep your design organized and easy to locate, so it can be easy access for the people.
